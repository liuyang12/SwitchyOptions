Option backup for SwitchyOmega
## Case of use
The backup file is for education network users who are using [SwitchyOmega](https://github.com/FelisCatus/SwitchyOmega "SwitchyOmega") surfing the internet outside of the GREAT WALL for academic purpose (with an exaggerated smile) only. The AutoProxy mode helps with direct access to the academic sites, such as [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/ "Springer Nature") with authorized IP address from the university library. 

There two principal advantages applying the AutoProxy mode,
1. save your data consumption via IPv4 connections, for the education network users can set the web proxy tool, such as [GoAgent](https://github.com/goagent/goagent "GoAgent") and its alternatives [XX-Net](https://github.com/XX-net/XX-Net "XX-Net"), [goaproxy](https://github.com/phuslu/goproxy "goproxy") with IPv6 connnections.
2. direct access to academic websites with IP authority from your university library.

## Notes of use
The SwitchyOmega has its own synchronization option in beta, unfortunately the size of the synchronized file is limited to seveal kilobytes which prevents the users from synchronizing a relative large configuration file. The other door open for this issue is the online backup option. Enjoy your surfing and academic reading!
